# Eat Genius

## Overview

This app is meant to streamline the decision making process of a group when deciding where to go out to eat.

## What is the problem you are trying to solve?

This application solves the problem of reaching a group (2 - 5 person) consensus on where to eat out. Often times it is difficult to find a place  that everyone can agree on, especially when dining with more than two people.

This application provides a simple user interface that allows individual users to form dining party groups, and then individually review suggested restaurants that meet predetermined criteria for dining options. Users will enter their groups location and may provide an optional cuisine type before viewing establishments provided from the Yelp API.

The information presented would be the name of the establishment, a photo if one is available, the Yelp star rating and recent reviews. Users can then either approve or disapprove of the dining option. If approved by a user, the database would track that establishment as a possible option and then include it to be shown to the other users in the group. At any time during the voting process a user may go back to the group page to see the list of top rated restaurants in the group.

Users would then be provided the option of continuing to review more establishments and add more options to the list of places of where to eat.

## Who is the product for? Who is your primary user? What is his or her story?  When and in what context is he most likely to use your product?

Our primary user is Jerome, a 29 year old male living in the Seattle area. Jerome is a University of Washington Alumni and now works for a local tech company. He and his friends have disposable income and go out to eat a few nights a week. They like to take advantage of all the different cuisines and new restaurants that Seattle has to offer but often times it's very difficult to decide where to go with friends. Jerome wants an application that will help them reach a group consensus quicker, while helping them venture out to new places and neighborhoods when they go out.

## What is the context

Jerome is going to use this most often during the evening while either out with friends or at his own house while alone. Everyone in the group will be able to vote on restaurants individually before they have left their house.

## Primary Use Case
Jerome has a texting group with his friends who are going out to eat together, and people are debating where to go. He texts to the group “Hold on guys let’s vote on a Eat Genius group.” He then creates a group in the app and adds all of his friends. They all start voting on restaurants, and in a few minutes it’s pretty clear that the majority of the group are happy going to Canlis.
